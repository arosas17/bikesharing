## Overview
In an attempt to create a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, a story is created to demonstrate to investors that this idea is a strong business proposal. The data used is based off the CitiBike data of New York City to see what potential patterns and trends that may occur. To create a story with strong visualization, the data needed to be reformatted using pandas. After, Tableau Public was used to make visualizations that will make the data easy to comprehend.

## Results
![Generic_charts](/Images/Generic_charts.png)
In these charts show a general data analysis of the data. The line graph demonstrates durations of each trip. Based on this data, it shows a large peak for the first 20 minutes, with the tip of this peak going over 140K for a short while. By the time the first hour is completed, the number of bikes checked out is approaching zero. This implies that the bike-sharing program in Des Moines should expect a similar trend where most bikes are out for about an hour.

The heatmap on the right side shows the start times of the trips over the course of a week. The general pattern here is that there are high points of activity at 7AM to 9AM and 4PM to 7PM on weekdays, but on the weekends the high points of activity are from 11AM to 6PM. Because of the times that occur on the weekdays, there is some suggestion that people use the bike-sharing program for transportation from and to work or appointments while weekends are most likely using the bikes as a leisurely activity.

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis
There is a description of the results for each visualization
Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.


Suspect suscribers use bikes for transportation purposes while customer utilize it for lesure.
## Summary

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.


2 additional visual data sets:
  Bike ultilization and location and travel of heavily ultilized bikes. Bike ultilization was not placed in story because it cannot say much of a story on its own.
  Other than that, I am curious to see what is the age demographic is.
