## Overview
In an attempt to create a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, a story is created to demonstrate to investors that this idea is a strong business proposal. The data used is based off the CitiBike data of New York City to see what potential patterns and trends that may occur. To create a story with strong visualization, the data needed to be reformatted using pandas. After, Tableau Public was used to make visualizations that will make the data easy to comprehend.

There is a description of the results for each visualization
Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.


2 additional visual data sets:
  Bike ultilization and location and travel of heavily ultilized bikes. Bike ultilization was not placed in story because it cannot say much of a story on its own.
  Other than that, I am curious to see what is the age demographic is.
